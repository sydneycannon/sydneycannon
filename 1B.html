      I'd say I've seen some beautiful days, I've walked countless coastlines, awoken on mountain tops, I have seen death and birth and kissed good lips
        </p>
    <p>
        I don't need a music machine to tell me what a good story is, and matter of fact I've never asked nothing of nobody
    </p>
    <p>
    I've taken my motorbike down the Pacific 101 and I have stoof atop the Empire State Building with my father
    </p>
    <p>
    I've ridden in fear, although, I was afriad every single time
        </p>
    I've learned that every waking moment is enough <br/> and excess never leads to better things, it only piles and piles atop the things that are already abundently in front of you <br/> like breathing and chasing and slow dancing and love making, fighting and laughing
    </p>
    <p>
    I am unhinged, unworthy, and distasteful to mostly everyone I meet,<br/> however I am loyal to a fault to anyone I find kindness in, I do not and will not fear tomorrow because I feel as though today as been enough
        </p>
    <p>
    And I got no hate in my heart for anything, anywhere, or anyone
    </p>
    <p>
    And I think fear and Fridays got an aawful lot in common, they're overdone and glorified and always leave you wantin'
    </p>

    Yeah, I think fear and Fridays got an awful lot in common, they're overdone and glorified and they always leave you wantin'
