        <td class="graph">Home runs. The baseball we watch today is Babe Ruth's game. Many players make an impact, a few become 
        folk heroes, but nobody changed a sport like Ruth did when he joined the Yankees and transformed baseball into a game of power. No player
        dominated his era like Ruth. He led his league in home runs 12 times, often out-homering entire teams, and 13 times in slugging and OPS. He
        slugged .690 ... for his career. He slugged .744 in 41 World Series Games. He won all three of his World Series starts as a pitcher, one 
        of them 14 innings. He called his shot. Or maybe he didn't. Does it matter?</td>

        <td>Willie Mays</td>
        <td>Center Field</td>
            <td>Birmingham Black Barons, New York/San Francisco Giants, New York Mets</td>
            <td class="graph">For playing a shallow center field at a cavernous Polo Grounds, sprinting toward the center-field fence and 
                making an improbable over-the-shoulder basket catch at the warning 
                track with the score tied late in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. 
                It's a play known simply as "The Catch," and it epitomized Mays -- the athleticism, the grace, the ingenuity. Mays went on to win 12 Gold Gloves, 
                but he was also an elite hitter, averaging 40 home runs per season from 1954 through 1966. And he ran with the best of them,
                leading the majors in stolen bases for four straight years from 1956 to 1959. His unmatched collection of skills made him the 
                greatest center fielder who ever lived.</td>

        <td>Hank Aaron</td>
        <td>Right Field</td>
        <td>Indianapolis Clowns, Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, Mikwaukee Brewers</td>
        <td class="graph">7-5-5. Even today, if you ask a lifelong baseball fan how many homers Aaron hit, they'll probably be able to tail you. 
            You ask how many Barry Bonds hit, and they might have to whip out their smartphone. When Aaron's pursuit of Babe Ruth's career homer 
            record culminated in No. 715 on April 8, 1974, it was an iconic event in American history. And yet, Aaron was not really a home run hitter. 
            He was a great hitter, period, as evidenced by his 305 lifetime average and 3,771 hits. Aaron's 2,297 RBls remain the career record, one that 
            is probably safe for a long time to come. When Aaron died just over a year ago, he was even more lauded for his presence off the field. 
            And few did more on the field than Henry Aaron.</td>

        <tr>
        <td> Ty Cobb</td>
        <td>Center Field</td>
        <td>Detriot Tigers, Philadelphia Athletics</td>
        <td class="graph">In an era when batting average reigned supreme, Cobb was the greatest 
            of 'em all: He won a record 12 batting titles, hit .400 three times and finished with the highest lifetime average in MLB history. He played a game 
            where you had to outthink the opponent, not outslug. Nearly 100 years since he played his final game, the image of Cobb remains vivid: the sharpened spikes, 
            the aggression, the fiery temperament. Through the years, it became difficult to separate fact from fiction. "They were all against me," Cobb wrote in his autobiography. 
            "But I beat the bastards down and left them in the ditch." Babe Ruth put it this
            way: "Cobb is a p---k. But he sure can hit. God Almighty, that man can hit."</td>

        <tr>
        <td>Ted Williams</td>
        <td>Left Field</td>
        <td>Boston Red Sox</td>
        <td class="graph">Williams was probably the greatest hitter who ever lived, largely because of the astronomical numbers he put up but also because of how he revolutionized the approach to hitting. 
            His book, "The Science of Hitting," came out in 1970 and is still referenced frequently today, preaching modern-day concepts such as swinging with a slight uppercut, 
            letting the hips lead and focusing on the parts of the strike zone where hitters can do the most damage. Williams boasts the highest on-base percentage in baseball history and is the 
            last hitter to reach a 400 batting average. At ages 39 and 40, in 1957 and '58, he won the ALbatting title. And his career totals could have been even higher had he not missed three 
            prime seasons to serve in World War II.</td>
